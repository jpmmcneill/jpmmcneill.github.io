        <h3> Context of my Review:</h3>
            <p>
                I use bike computers primarily for navigation. Most of my riding is either training rides or bikepacking.
                Because I don't do road racing, some potential features (such as ease of reading the screen quickly) are not important to me.
                My previous bike computer was a Polar v650. The Karoo cost me 400 euro, which is quite expensive but not top of the line pricing (see Garmin edge 1030).
                This is also the current RRP on the hammerhead website, although other retailers have the price a little higher.
            </p>
            <h3> Overall Review:</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a big fan of the Karoo 2. The one feature that I particularly like is how smoothly it operates with the slick web UI that Hammerhead offer.
                    This web app allows for route planning, integrations & ride history.
                    The one thing lacking from this UI is deep ride analytics, Polar do this very well with Polar Flow and I'm a little disappointed that Hammerhead don't have a similar offering.
                    It is worth noting that this computer only comes with a out front mount, meaning that if your handlebars are not circular (for example, aero bars or ones with hydraulic brake converters) you will need an aftermarket mount to use the computer.

        <h3> Stuff I like:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Screen</li>
                    <p>
                        The Karoo 2s screen is very clear and has enough brightness to be used in bright daylight while still being clear.
                        Its brightness can also be turned down enough to be used in low light / night time conditions.
                    </p>
                <li>WiFi Support</li>
                    <p>
                        The Karoo 2 has the capability of updating, syncing rides & refreshing routes via a WiFi connection.
                        While this is probably seen as a standard in the 2020s, it was a very welcome improvement over the v650 that I used to have.
                        I haven't run into any problems getting the Karoo 2 to connect to wifi. When a ride is finished, it is stored in the memory of the computer.
                        Once it gains a WiFi connection, this ride is then uploaded to web platforms (for example strava).
                    </p>
                <li>Route Planning</li>
                    <p>
                        Hammerhead have a proprietary map planning software, available at dashboard.hammerhead.io.
                        This allows Karoo 2 owners to plan routes without necessarily having subscriptions such as strava premium. Once created, these routes will automatically sync with your Karoo 2 over WiFi.
                        This tool is really easy to use and avoids having to do a dance of strava -> import to a different tool -> download to a bike computer.
                        The in ride HUD also gives helpful information given a route, such as elevation profiles, distance to turns as well as the standard SATNAV style map view.
                    </p>
                <li>Integrations</li>
                    <p>
                        There are several first class integrations with the Karoo 2. These are: Strava, Komoot, TrainingPeaks, RidewithGPS & Xert.
                        I've only used the strava integration. Integrations are controlled via dashboard.hammerhead.io, and (for) once set up rides that you complete will automatically upload to strava.
                        This is something you can control on a ride by ride basis with the end of ride screen on the computer itself.
                        While I haven't tested the other ones myself, I assume the other integrations work as smoothly.
                    </p>
                <li>Presets for Ride HUD</li>
                    <p>
                        It is relatively straightforward to set custom ride screens in a profile. These profiles can be selected a ride commences, as can be customised quite a bit.
                        There are many different options for metrics as one would expect from an upmarket bike computer.
                    </p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3> Stuff I don't like:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Battery Life </li>
                <p>
                    The Karoo 2s battery life seems to last around 8 hours when many sensors are enabled and a route is active. While this is plenty of time for training rides, it is not ideal for longer races / gran fondos etc.
                    General consensus seems to have the Karoo 2's battery life being lower than it's competitors. The Karoo 2 is charged with a USB C cable, which is refreshingly modern.
                </p>
                <li>Charging during rides</li>
                <p>
                    For longer rides its important to charge the Karoo 2 during use. This is quite difficult to do with the out of the box out front mount, as there is not enough space between the rear of the computer and the handlerbar.
                    Again, this means an aftermarket mount is required. At least hammerhead provide a garmin mount adapter, meaning that there are reasonably cheap options available if required.

                </p>
                <li>"In ride" profile changing</li>
                <p>
                    I can see a reasonably common situation where you want to change the metrics you see during a ride. This is not possible with the Karoo 2 (other than swiping between screens).
                    This is a bit of a negative, but I'm not sure whether many computers give you this flexibility.
                </p>
                <li>Routes in different profiles are hard</li>
                <p>
                    While both routes and profiles are independently easy to use, it's quite tricky to get a specific route set up with a profile.
                    You have to enable the route, then exit the ride and restart it with the profile you want. This is not obvious and took a good bit of figuring out.
                </p>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3> What you get in the box:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The bike computer itself</li>
                <li>Handlebar computer mount (out front) </li>
                <li>USB C cable</li>
                <li>Garmin mount converter</li>
                <li>Allen Key for adjusting / installing mount</li>
                <li>Laynard</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3> What I'd prefer to have:</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stem mount</li>
                <p>
                    As charging is impossible from the out front mount with most USB C cables an some handlebars will not support the out front mount (for example aero bars), I'd have like to see a stem mount coming in the box as well.
                    This is just some extra overhead that may be required by some people.
                </p>
                <li>Change ride reporting profiles from the web dashboard</li>
                <p>
                    You have to change ride profiles on the computer itself, which is a small screen. This can be a little frustrating.
                    I'd much prefer to do this on the web app, and it seems a bit of an oversight that this feature is missing.
                </p>
            </ul>
