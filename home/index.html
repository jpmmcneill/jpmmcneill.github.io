Hi, I'm James McNeill!

I studied theoretical physics in College (in Dublin, Ireland).

I enjoy cycling (everything from doing long distance bike races to watching pro bike races like the Tour de France). 

I also really like theoretical ecology, and would love to study it further at some point (either a Masters or a PhD).

I really like data problems and data tooling. You can see me giving a talk about duckdb on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oh0Y3MN2Tas">youtube</a>.

I also run a data meetup in Dublin

I currently work in <a href="https://sig.com/">Susquehanna International Group (SIG)</a> in the Quantitative Research department.
SIG is a global trading firm that includes areas of operations such as options market making.

I used to work at <a href="https://conjura.com/">Conjura</a> as lots of things, but my final position was an Engineering Manager.
Conjura aims to solve a problem of standardising analytics flows for ecommerce companies at varying scales, using technology such as:

<ul>
  <li>aws</li>
  <li>airbyte</li>
  <li>snowflake</li>
  <li>duckdb</li>
  <li>dbt</li>
  <li>python</li>
</ul>

I hope to include a few things on this website, including:
<ul>
  <li>
    My pet project on modelling evolution in Theoretical Ecology (this is <a href="https://jpmmcneill.github.io/systems">here</a>)
  </li>
  <li>My experience with cycling, especially kit recommendations and reviews for ultra endurance racing (this is <a href="https://jpmmcneill.github.io/reviews/">here</a>)</li>
  <li>Interesting Physics and Code problems</li>
  <li>And hopefully some other things...</li>
</ul>
