Hi, I'm James McNeill!

I studied theoretical physics in College (in Dublin, Ireland).

I enjoy cycling (everything from doing long distance bike races to watching pro bike races like the Tour de France). 

I also really like theoretical ecology, and would love to study it further at some point (either a Masters or a PhD).

I'm currently working as a Product Lead in Conjura, trying to solve a problem of standardising analytics flows for companies at varying scales, using technology such as:
<ul>
  <li>dbt</li>
  <li>python</li>
  <li>snowflake</li>
  <li>aws</li>
</ul>

I'm hoping to include a few things here, including:
<ul>
  <li>My pet project on modelling evolution in Theoretical Ecology</li>
  <li>My experience with cycling, especially kit recommendations and reviews for ultra endurance racing</li>
  <li>Interesting Physics and Code problems</li>
  <li>And hopefully some other things...</li>
</ul>
